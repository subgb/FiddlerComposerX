# Fiddler ComposerX Mod

ComposerX is a Fiddler Classic extension that improves upon the original Composer, allowing for easier editing of HTTP requests.

In ComposerX, request headers, cookies, query string, and form body are parsed into multiple lines of text, with each line displaying one item. You can conveniently add or remove items, and you can temporarily ignore an item by prefixing the line with `//`.


### Install

Download the `FiddlerComposerX.dll` and `Newtonsoft.Json.dll` and place them under `%UserProfile%\Documents\Fiddler2\Scripts` directory.
Then restart Fiddler Classic.
